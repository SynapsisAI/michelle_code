  "Abstract": "A Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) study was performed to 1) predict the activity of new compounds as anti-colorectal cancer agents and 2) select chemical predictors that accurately model relationships between molecular structures and bioactivity against colon cancer cell lines. Logistic regression was used to obtain coefficients for the QSAR classification model. Quantum chemical predictors were found to be significant predictors, such as the total electronic energy (ET), charge of the most positive atom (Qmax) and electrophilicity (\u03c9), thus validating the need to consider them besides those routinely used in anti-colorectal cancer agents QSAR. The model selected simple and significant predictors that can be obtained directly using information from gaseous-state Gaussian optimisation at HF/3-21G in a vacuum, with no external calculation software, providing an inexpensive yet robust QSAR model. In addition, two interaction terms were proven to be significant at 95 % confidence level, reiterating the importance of interaction between predictors that is not commonly seen in QSAR models.",
  "Introduction": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer worldwide [1], besetting more than a million people every year [2]. It is the second leading cause of death among various types of cancer, with 935 000 deaths in 2020 [3]. Surgery is only successful in CRC treatment in the early localised stage when it is limited within the wall of the colon [4]. Furthermore, CRC has little response to radiation [5], which makes chemotherapy crucial in the treatment of widespread malignancies of CRC [6]. Therefore, the discovery of new anticancer drugs that have higher efficacy and more manageable side effects is extremely vital [7].\n\nHowever, drug discovery is a complex, expensive and time-consuming process, with only 11 % success rate in 2014 [8]. Thus, computational methodologies have been employed to minimise costs and shorten the research cycle, in which QSAR is a powerful approach to identify lead compound [9]. QSAR was first developed by Hansch [10] 40 years ago. It involves building a robust statistical algorithm that relates the molecular structures of a molecule to its activity, by selecting appropriate molecular descriptors [11]. As such, the potential of a newly discovered compound can be validated [12]. QSAR has helped to speed up the evaluation of drug compounds properties [13], thus accelerating the development of new drugs [14].\n\nIn binary classification problems, QSAR models have been proven to be very effective [15]. There has been numerous literature on modelling anti-CRC activity, such as Kim BS et al. [16], Sagir Yusuf Ismail et al. [9], Verma et al. [17], Deokar et al. [18], Rybka et al. [19] and Cruz et al. [20]. These QSAR models used structural, geometrical and topological descriptors to predict the anti-CRC activity of compounds. However, very few of these QSAR models selected quantum chemical predictors. Quantum chemical predictors, such as highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and charge predictors, have been shown to encapsulate information that characterises the reactivity, shape and binding properties [21]. Shruti et al. [22] showed that the best anti-cancer agents QSAR model required MiERIC, MiERIN, MaREHN quantum chemical predictors from the CODESSA programme [23]. Violeta Markovi\u0107 et al. [24] proved that quantum-chemical predictors were crucial in predicting anti-tumour activity of edaravone derivatives. However, they have hitherto gained little recognition in anti-CRC QSAR. Thus, this represents an opportunity to explore more into this area.",
  "Materials and methods": "The study collected a dataset of 1122 compounds (563 active, 559 inactive). Predictors were extracted using Gaussian 16 at HF/3-21G optimisation. 43 total descriptors were reduced to 20 via PCA. Interaction terms were tested for significance and added to the logistic regression model using the Wald test. The methodology includes dataset curation, Gaussian-based descriptor extraction, principal component analysis, interaction term testing, logistic regression modelling, and validation through internal, external, and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO).",
  "Results and discussion": "PCA showed PC1 accounted for the most variance, helping separate active from inactive compounds. Key predictors included ET, \u03c9, Qmax, and structural features like aromatic carbon count. Logistic regression selected 12 predictors, including two interaction terms (\u03c9\u00d7Nounsub aromatic C and NoArNHR\u00d7NoOH). The final model had high internal validation (McFadden\u2019s R\u00b2 = 0.96555), external accuracy (85.30%), and LOO validation (86.01%). These results underscore the value of combining structural and quantum chemical descriptors with interaction terms to improve QSAR model performance and interpretation.",
  "Conclusion": "By considering both quantum chemical and structural predictors, the proposed QSAR model correctly classified 85.30 % of active and inactive compounds in the test set. It also has relatively high McFadden\u2019s R2, suggesting good goodness of fit. The model selected 12 predictors, 9 structural and 3 quantum-chemical related predictors from PCA and the Wald test, that are sufficiently rich in electronic and quantum chemical information to encode molecular structures and predict anti-CRC profiles. Structural fragments with positive contribution to anti-CRC activity were reported to be used in the design of new active compounds. The model also proves the significance of interaction terms, and hence, the importance of interaction between predictors."
