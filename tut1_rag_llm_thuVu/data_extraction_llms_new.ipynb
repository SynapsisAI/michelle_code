Logistic regression was used to \\nobtain coefficients for the QSAR classification model. Quantum chemical predictors were found to be significant \\npredictors, such as the total electronic energy (E\\nT\\n), charge of the most positive atom (Q\\nmax\\n) and electrophilicity \\n( ω ), thus validating the need to consider them besides those routinely used in anti-colorectal cancer agents QSAR. \\nThe model selected simple and significant predictors that can be obtained directly using information from \\ngaseous-state Gaussian optimisation at HF/3-21G in a vacuum, with no external calculation software, providing \\nan inexpensive yet robust QSAR model. In addition, two interaction terms were proven to be significant at 95 % \\nconfidence level, reiterating the importance of interaction between predictors that is not commonly seen in QSAR \\nmodels.   \\nIntroduction \\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of cancer \\nworldwide [1] , besetting more than a million people every year [2] . It is \\nthe second leading cause of death among various types of cancer, with \\n935 000 deaths in 2020 [3] . Surgery is only successful in CRC treatment \\nin the early localised stage when it is limited within the wall of the colon \\n[4] . Furthermore, CRC has little response to radiation [5] , which makes \\nchemotherapy crucial in the treatment of widespread malignancies of \\nCRC [6] . Therefore, the discovery of new anticancer drugs that have \\nhigher efficacy and more manageable side effects is extremely vital [7] . \\nHowever, drug discovery is a complex, expensive and time- \\nconsuming process, with only 11 % success rate in 2014 [8] . Thus, \\ncomputational methodologies have been employed to minimise costs \\nand shorten the research cycle, in which QSAR is a powerful approach to \\nidentify lead compound [9] . QSAR was first developed by Hansch [10] \\n40 years ago. It involves building a robust statistical algorithm that re -\\nlates the molecular structures of a molecule to its activity, by selecting \\nappropriate molecular descriptors [11] . As such, the potential of a newly \\ndiscovered compound can be validated [12] . QSAR has helped to speed \\nup the evaluation of drug compounds properties [13] , thus accelerating \\nthe development of new drugs [14] . \\nIn binary classification problems, QSAR models have been proven to \\nbe very effective [15] .There has been numerous literature on modelling \\nanti-CRC activity, such as Kim BS et al. [16] , Sagir Yusuf Ismail et al. [9] , \\nVerma et al. [17] , Deokar et al. [18] , Rybka et al. [19] and Cruz et al. \\n[20] . These QSAR models used structural, geometrical and topological \\ndescriptors to predict the anti-CRC activity of compounds. However, \\nvery few of these QSAR models selected quantum chemical predictors. \\nQuantum chemical predictors, such as highest occupied molecular \\norbital (HOMO), lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and \\ncharge predictors, have been shown to encapsulate information that \\ncharacterises the reactivity, shape and binding properties [21] . Shruti \\net al. [22] showed that the best anti-cancer agents QSAR model required \\nMiERIC, MiERIN, MaREHN quantum chemical predictors from the \\nCODESSA programme [23] . Violeta Markovi ´c et al. [24] proved that \\nquantum-chemical predictors were crucial in predicting anti-tumour \\nactivity of edaravone derivatives. However, they have hitherto gained \\nlittle recognition in anti-CRC QSAR. Thus, this represents an opportunity \\nto explore more into this area. \\n* Corresponding author. \\nE-mail address: chmmiy@nus.edu.sg (M.Y.

[4] ) or Spartan 14 Wave function software \\n(Ismail et al. [9] ). Other non-quantum chemical and structural pre -\\ndictors are also calculated by external software, such as Canvas of the \\nSchrodinger Suite, Virtual Computational Chemistry Laboratory [25] \\nand PaDEL-Descriptor [26] (Deokar et al. [18] , Rybka et al. [19] and \\nCruz et al. ’ s [20] ). Thus, there is potential in using simple predictors \\nwithout external calculation software, to obtain a reliable model that is \\ninexpensive and more convenient. \\nLastly, most QSAR studies predicting activity against cancer cell lines \\nuse MLR models with single linear terms, such as in the works of Girgis \\net al., Zolnowska et al., Slawinski et al. and Gramatica et al. [27 – 31] . \\nHowever, the structural and quantum chemical predictors may interact \\nwith one another, a phenomenon usually observed in machine learning \\nproblems [32] . Therefore, there is a need to address the lack of inter -\\naction terms in QSAR models. \\nHence, this research aims to generate a statistically valid, robust and \\ninexpensive model to predict the anti-CRC activity without the use of \\nexternal calculation software. It also evaluates the significance of \\nquantum chemical predictors and the importance of interaction between \\npredictors in QSAR studies. \\nMaterials and methods \\nThe procedures used in this research are summarised in Fig. 1 . \\nDataset \\nThe complete dataset has 563 compounds with anti-CRC activity \\nagainst ten CRC cell lines from Alejandro Speck-Planche et al. ’ s work \\n[33] , and other 559 inactive drugs extracted from the ChemBL database \\n[34] . These drugs ’ profiles did not include anti-CRC activity and thus \\nwere considered inactive. In total, there are 1122 compounds (See \\nTable 1 ). There are approximately equal numbers of active and inactive \\ncompounds in the dataset, which generate higher accuracy and balanced \\ndetection rate [35] . \\nExtracting predictors from Gaussian output files \\nAll molecules were optimised in the gaseous state and in a vacuum at \\nHF/3-21G (Hartree-Fock), using Gaussian 16 [36] . A Python code was \\nused to extract a total of 43 predictors, 25 quantum chemical predictors \\nand 18 structural predictors from the Gaussian output log files. A pre -\\nliminary Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ( Appendix A ) was used for \\npredictor screening to reduce 43 descriptors to 20 descriptors, by \\nFig. 1.

Only significant terms (determined by the Wald test at 95 % \\nconfidence level) were selected.

The first three \\nprincipal components ’ percentage of explained total variance is: PC1- \\n20.5 %, PC2-17.1 %, PC3-11 % ( Fig. 3 a). PC1 accounts for the most \\nvariance, with 20.5 %. Several score plots were examined and the most \\ninformative one, which shows the separation of two classes most clearly, \\nis the PC2 against PC1 plot ( Fig. 3 b – see Table 2 for predictor numbers \\nfrom 1 to 20). \\nFrom the biplot, PC1 is responsible for the separation between the \\ncompounds with and without anti-CRC activity. Predictors with the \\nhighest loading of PC1 are selected. They are those that have the longest \\nloading vectors along the PC1 axis, such as total electronic energy, \\nelectrophilicity, electronegativity, mass-related predictors, and aro -\\nmatic carbon-related predictors. Therefore, PCA results initially show \\nthat quantum chemical predictors play a role in contributing to the \\nvariance of the response. Afterwards, the selected predictors undergo \\nthe Wald test of significance in the QSAR model, before being chosen for \\nthe final model. \\nFig. 3. (a) Scree plot of 20 principal component. (b).

There should be more attention to test interaction terms in \\nQSAR, especially in anti-CRC QSAR. \\nQSAR result \\nThe final logistic regression model has 12 variables, including 2 \\ninteraction terms, all have null hypothesis rejected in the Wald test \\n( Appendix C ). Its equation is shown below, where β is the coefficients \\nvector, X is the variables vector and π is the probability of the compound \\nbeing active: \\nπ ( X ) =\\n1\\n1 + e\\n\\x00 β • X\\n(1)  \\nin which   \\nInternal and external model validation \\nFor internal validation, a fairly high McFadden ’ s R\\n2 \\nof 0.96555 en -\\nsures the developed QSAR model ’ s goodness of fit, which implies the \\nmodel ’ s robustness (see Table 3 ). For external validation, a relatively \\nhigh accuracy of 85.30 % on the test set also implies its strong predictive \\npower for novel compounds. Therefore, it shows that the QSAR model \\nfor CRC is reliable to classify active and inactive compounds and predict \\nthe activity of novel agents. It also reiterates the possibility to generate a \\nrobust QSAR model using simple predictors, both structural and quan -\\ntum chemical, without external calculation software. The sensitivity can \\nbe further explained by the confusion matrix in Fig. 5 . \\nThe number of True Positive (TP) predictions is 208, of True Nega -\\ntive (TN) predictions is 175, while of False Positive (FP) is 22 and of \\nFalse Negative (FN) is 44. Sensitivity, which is the measure to check \\ncorrectly positive predicted outcomes out of the total number of true \\npositive outcomes,of the model is 208/(208 + 44) = 0.82540. This \\nmodel had the highest sensitivity among all different QSAR logistic \\nregression models generated. High sensitivity is particularly important \\nin the case of identifying active anti-CRC agents when it is more detri -\\nmental to have FN than FP. \\nFor FN, if there are wrong predictions of active agents as inactive, \\nactual active compounds will be overlooked in preliminary screening, \\nwhich reduces the chance of finding a novel anti-cancer agent. Mean -\\nwhile, for FP, an inactive compound predicted as active can still be \\neliminated upon further checking. Therefore, high sensitivity of 0.82540 \\nimplies the model ’ s power to correctly predict observations in the pos -\\nitive class and minimise FN when predicting anti-CRC activity. \\nAdditionally, the logistic regression explains how the structural key \\npoints correlate to differential behaviour in bioactivity against colon \\ncancer cells. The magnitudes and signs of the coefficients have signifi -\\ncant roles in deciding the overall biological activity of the molecule. In \\nthis study, the descriptors with positive coefficients are very significant \\nby contributing towards increasing anti-CRC. \\n̅̅̅̅ ̅\\nM\\n√\\n, No\\naromatic C\\n, Pre -\\nsence\\nCO\\n, No\\nArNHR\\n, No\\noxetane\\n, ω *No\\nunsub aromatic C \\nhave positive co -\\nefficients. Therefore, molecules with high molecular mass, a large \\nnumber of aromatic carbons, carbonyl groups, fragments of type ArNHR \\nand oxetane rings; as well as high value of electrophilicity interacting \\nwith unsubstituted aromatic carbons tend to be more active. These \\ncharacteristics are useful in designing new compounds with high anti- \\nCRC activity. \\nFurthermore, even though E\\nT\\n, Q\\nmax \\nand ω *No\\nunsub aromatic C \\nare the \\nonly three quantum chemical-related predictors in the final model, at -\\ntempts made to remove those from the equation decreased the accuracy \\nsubstantially. Thus, the contribution of those three significant quantum \\nchemical predictors validates the need to consider quantum chemical \\npredictors. They play a role in governing bioactivity against colorectal \\ncancer cell lines and should not be undermined in future QSAR works. \\nAmong many promising quantum chemical predictors after PCA, \\nonly E\\nT\\n, Q\\nmax \\nand ω *No\\nunsub aromatic C \\nhad the null hypothesis rejected by \\nthe Wald test. Note that even though E\\nT \\nhas a small coefficient, a smaller \\nstandard deviation (0.0000832019) gave rise to high Z-score that rejects \\nthe null hypothesis. After many attempts, these 3 predictors also gave \\nbetter logistic regression models with higher accuracy compared to \\nother quantum chemical predictors. This result shows that the three \\npredictors are more essential in explaining anti-CRC activity. \\nMoreover, it is also interesting to note that compounds with high \\nω *No\\nunsub aromatic \\nare more active. While electrophilicity is not a sig -\\nnificant predictor and was removed by the Wald test, its interaction term \\nwith unsubstituted aromatic carbons serves as a very significant pre -\\ndictor that increases anti-CRC activity. Therefore, the ability of the \\nmolecule to accept electron pairs interacting with unsubstituted aro -\\nmatic carbons may control chemical reactions that determine anti-CRC \\nactivity. \\nAdditionally, between the square root of molecular mass and mo -\\nlecular mass, only the square root of molecular mass is proven to be \\nsignificant by the Wald test. The logistic regression model with the \\nsquare root of molecular mass also gave better results. The insight that \\nsquare root molecular mass serves better than molecular mass is also \\nseen in past QSAR works [38] , which is useful for future anti-CRC QSAR. \\nLeave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) \\nBesides internal and external validation, LOO was used to evaluate \\nthe model ’ s predictive power. One compound from the set of 1122 \\ncompounds is extracted each time. The model is recalculated using a \\ntraining set of 1121(n-1) compounds, so that each compound is pre -\\ndicted once. In classification problems, the statistical metric is the per -\\ncentage of observations correctly classified during the n repeated model \\nfittings [39] . \\n86.01 % of 1122 predictions from 1121 different logistic regression \\nmodels were correct (see Table 4 ). It reiterates the model ’ s high accu -\\nracy to predict novel compounds, as well as robustness in predicting \\nanti-CRC activity. \\nConclusion \\nBy considering both quantum chemical and structural predictors, the \\nproposed QSAR model correctly classified 85.30 % of active and inactive \\ncompounds in the test set. It also has relatively high McFadden ’ s R\\n2\\n, \\nsuggesting good goodness of fit. The model selected 12 predictors, 9 \\nstructural and 3 quantum-chemical related predictors from PCA and the \\nWald test, that are sufficiently rich in electronic and quantum chemical \\ninformation to encode molecular structures and predict anti-CRC pro -\\nfiles. Structural fragments with positive contribution to anti-CRC ac -\\ntivity were reported to be used in the design of new active compounds. \\nThe model also proves the significance of interaction terms, and hence, \\nthe importance of interaction between predictors.

The maximum residual variance is given by \\nthe first principal component axis; the second principal component, orthogonal to the first one, has the second maximum variance and so on. In this \\nway, maximum amounts of statistical information can be preserved and visualized [40,41] . Before applying PCA, the dataset was scaled to unit \\nstandard variation and zero mean so that the variables could be compared to each other on the same scale. \\nIn this study, PCA was initially used to select 20 most potential predictors from the pool of 43 predictors. This is achieved by: first, predictors which \\nhave exceedingly small angles between their loading vectors, which suggests they are correlated [42] , were removed to ensure no predictor carries the \\nsame information. Then, predictors with highest loading values of PC1, which suggested they were responsible for the variance of response, were \\nselected. Consequently, the dataset with 20 predictors further underwent PCA to select linear terms for the model. \\nAppendix B \\nLogistic regression  \\n1) Formula of logistic regression \\nLogistic regression is one of the most widely applied machine learning tools in binary classification problems [43] . The equation for multiple binary \\nlogistic regression model is as followed [44] . X is the predictor vector. π denotes the predicted probability of the compound being active, ranging from \\n0 (inactive) to 1 (active). \\nπ ( X ) =\\ne\\nβ\\n0\\n+ β\\n1\\nX\\n1\\n+ ⋯ + β\\nk\\nX\\nk\\n1 + e\\nβ\\n0\\n+ β\\n1\\nX\\n1\\n+ ⋯ + β\\nk\\nX\\nk\\n=\\ne\\nβ • X\\n1 + e\\nβ • X\\n=\\n1\\n1 + e\\n\\x00 β • X \\nLogistic regression uses Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), in which parameters β\\n0\\n, β\\n1\\n, . . ., β\\nk \\nare computed so that the final logistic \\nregression model has maximum log-likelihood [45] . \\nFor a sample of size n, the likelihood for the logistic regression model is given by \\nL ( β , y , X ) =\\n∏\\nn\\ni = 1\\nπ\\nY i\\ni\\n( 1 \\x00 π\\n1\\n)\\n1 \\x00 Y\\ni\\n=\\n∏\\nn\\ni = 1\\n(\\ne\\nX\\n1\\nβ\\n1 + e\\nX\\ni\\nβ\\n)\\nY i\\n(\\n1\\n1 + e\\nX\\ni\\nβ\\n)\\n1 \\x00 Y\\ni \\nThus, the log-likelihood is given by \\nl ( β ) =\\n∑\\nn\\ni = 1\\n[ y\\ni\\nlog ( π\\ni\\n) + ( 1 \\x00 y\\ni\\n) log ( 1 \\x00 π\\ni\\n) ]\\n=\\n∑\\nn\\ni = 1\\n[\\ny\\ni\\nX\\ni\\nβ \\x00 log\\n\\x00\\n1 + e\\nX i β\\n) ]\\nLog-likelihood of logistic regression plays a role analogous to the residual sum of squares in linear regression.

OPPENHEIMER*Princeton University, USASUMMARYMost texts on writing style encourage authors to avoid overly-complex words. However, a majorityof undergraduates admit to deliberately increasing the complexity of their vocabulary so as to givethe impression of intelligence. This paper explores the extent to which this strategy is effective.Experiments 1–3 manipulate complexity of texts and ﬁnd a negative relationship between complex-ity and judged intelligence. This relationship held regardless of the quality of the original essay, andirrespective of the participants’ prior expectations of essay quality. The negative impact ofcomplexity was mediated by processing ﬂuency. Experiment 4 directly manipulated ﬂuency andfound that texts in hard to read fonts are judged to come from less intelligent authors. Experiment 5investigated discounting of ﬂuency. When obvious causes for low ﬂuency exist that are not relevantto the judgement at hand, people reduce their reliance on ﬂuency as a cue; in fact, in an effort not tobe inﬂuenced by the irrelevant source of ﬂuency, they over-compensate and are biased in the oppositedirection. Implications and applications are discussed. Copyright#2005 John Wiley &\n",

      "surprising readers with the relative disﬂuency of the text.Both the experts and prevailing wisdom present plausible views, but which (if either) iscorrect? The present paper provides an empirical investigation of the strategy of complex-ity, and ﬁnds such a strategy to be unsuccessful. Five studies demonstrate that the loss ofﬂuency due to needless complexity in a text negatively impacts raters’ assessments of thetext’s authors.EXPERIMENT 1Experiment 1 aimed to answer several simple questions. First, does increasing thecomplexity of text succeed in making the author appear more intelligent? Second, towhat extent does the success of this strategy depend on the quality of the original, simplerwriting? Finally, if the strategy is unsuccessful, is the failure of the strategy due to loss ofﬂuency? To answer these questions, graduate school admission essays were made morecomplex by substituting some of the original words with their longest applicable thesaurusentries.140D. M. Oppenheimer\n",
